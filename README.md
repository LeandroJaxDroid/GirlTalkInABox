# Girl Talk in a Box

[Girl Talk in a Box](http://static.echonest.com/girltalkinabox/index.html "") is a web app that lets you play with your music. 

It uses The Echo Nest API to analyze a track and break it down into bars, beats, tatums, and then uses this data to create an
interactive visualization of the song. You can then interact with the song in all sorts of various ways.
